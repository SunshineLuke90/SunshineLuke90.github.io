                        Hello! I'm Lucius Creamer, a passionate GIS developer
                        with a love for creating beautiful and functional applications and maps.
                        I have been using GIS technology for almost 10 years, and I continue to
                        learn and grow in this field every day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-content">
                        I started my GIS journey early in
                        high school, learning the basics of GIS and cartography, and taking summer
                        internships at the City of Columbia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-content">
                        I went on to study Geography at Northwest Missouri State University,
                        where I earned my Bachelor's in Geography with a GIS emphasis.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-content">
                        During my time at Northwest, I was involved in founding a partnership between Northwest
                        and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), which allowed GIS students to get
                        hands-on experience with real world projects.

                <span slot="description">
                    <p class="about-content">
                        Currently, I work as a GIS Specialist supporting the Missouri State Emergency Managemnet Agency
                        (SEMA).
                        My role involves developing and maintaining GIS applications, analyzing risk, providing
                        situational
                        awareness, and supporting the mission of preparedness, response and recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-content">
                        My goal within SEMA is to improve the situational awareness tools that GIS can provide,
                        and to be able to provide some of those insights to the broader public.

                    <p class="about-content">
                        In my personal life, I enjoy working on GIS and web development projects, spending time with my
                        beautiful girlfriend, and taking time to travel and relax.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-content">
                        It's hard to determine what hobby I might pick up next, but
                        lately I enjoy video games, hiking and coding.
